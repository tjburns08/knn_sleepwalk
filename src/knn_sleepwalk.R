#' @title K-nearest neighbors Sleepwalk
#' @description Takes a data matrix and a 2-D embedding as input. It produces 
#' a 'KNN matrix' and places that along with the aforementioned inputs into the
#' sleepwalk function.
#' @param mat A data matrix with data points as rows and features as columns.
#' the matrix must already be filtered by the markers you care about.
#' @param embedding The 2-D embedding of the data matrix, in matrix format with
#' data points as rows and two columns.
#' @param k The number of nearest neighbors to be visualized

#' @title K-nearest neighbors Sleepwalk Direct
#' @description Takes a data matrix and a 2-D embedding as input. It produces 
#' a 'KNN matrix' and places that along with the aforementioned inputs into the
#' sleepwalk function. Unlike the default KNN sleepwalk function, this one makes
#' two KNN matrices, like UMAP space vs high-D space for comparisons across the
#' same embedding.
#' @param mat1 A data matrix with data points as rows and features as columns.
#' the matrix must already be filtered by the markers you care about.
#' @param mat2 A second data matrix in the format as above
#' @param embedding The 2-D embedding of the data matrix, in matrix format with
#' data points as rows and two columns.
#' @param k The number of nearest neighbors to be visualized
